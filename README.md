- ðŸ”­ Currently, I work at Alibaba Tongyi Lab. I received my Ph.D. degree from ShanghaiTech University in 2023. I was advised by [Prof. Kewei Tu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). 
- ðŸŒ± Currently, My researches are mainly focused on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **knowledge boundary** and **Agent** for textual LLMs and multi-modal LLMs.
- ðŸŒ± Before I received my Ph.D., my researches are mainly focused on **Structured Prediction** ([Syntactic](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/aacl-2020-second)/[Semantic](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2019-second) Dependency Parsing, [Sequence Labeling](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/emnlp-2020-ain) (such as [Named Entity Recognition](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2021-retrieval)), [Neural Architecture Search](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2021-ace) in structured prediction), [**Knowledge Distillation**](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2021-structural) and [**Multilingual NLP**](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2020-structure). I visited [Prof. Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei)'s lab as a visiting research fellow at [SUTD](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/).
